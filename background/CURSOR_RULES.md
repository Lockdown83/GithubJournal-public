# CURSOR RULES

This file contains rules and guidelines for using Cursor in the `background` directory of the GithubJournal project.

## General Guidelines
- Keep all background prompt and template files in this directory.
- Use clear, concise, and neutral language in prompts and templates.
- When editing or adding prompts, ensure they are open-ended and inclusive.
- Document any changes to prompt structure or logic in this file.

## File Naming
- Use `background-prompt.md` for the main prompt file.
- Use `background-template.md` for the main template file.
- Name any additional prompt or template files descriptively.

## Version Control
- Commit changes to background files with clear commit messages.
- Do not delete or overwrite existing prompts/templates without discussion or documentation here.

## Collaboration
- Coordinate with team members before making major changes to prompts or templates.
- Use comments in markdown files to explain non-obvious changes.
